<h1>tmsteph</h1>

<h3>My name is Thomas M. Stephens Jr.</h3>

<p> I've been collecting knowlege all over the 
internet and world.</p>

<p>This is somewhat of a portfolio. I could have made a simple Wordpress, bootstrap, or react site, 
but wanted to experiment building from scratch.</p>


</p>Check back often for updates! I'm starting with html, then CSS, I will 
add javascript, databases, react, threejs, react-three-fiber, A-frame, and more! 
 </p>
 <br>
 <p>The source code for this website can be found 
    <a href="https://github.com/tmsteph/tmsteph">here!</a></p>
<br>
<p>The goal is to create Something portable that can run on all devices 
    as well as be hosted to the web. I'd rather not have to have the user 
    install Node or other softare manually.</p>

<p>This will be a guide. Eventually 
I will make a forum. For people 
who want to make things out of scratch for free.</p>
<br>

<p>If this sounds interesting I'm on whatsapp at 864-360-2659 and email at tmsteph1290@gmail.com.</p>

<p>Please state your name and 
what I can help you with.</p>

<h2>Computer Science</h2>

<p>I've always loved playing with computers, but everyone always has a had a 
    hard time sitting down to program. There are so many options. So many ways to 
organize things. So many things to learn.</p> 
<p>I hope that while developing this website I can hash out a path that the 
    beginner can use</p>
    
    <h2>Suppliments</h2>
<p>I've found many suppliments to be helpful in my life. Like most people, I 
    have struggled with focus, energy, anxiety, and depression. 
</p> 
<p>Many of these 
things can be relieved through spiritual excercises such as Yoga and Meditation,
but it is nice to have options.</p>


<h2>Spirituality</h2>

<p>I have been always been fascinated with the bigger picture. 
    Why are we here? Where did we come from? Where are we going?
    What can we do to increase our capacity for love and expand that to 
    help others? </p>

    <p>Humanity has been on this planet for 250,000 years. 
    In a universe that is 4.6 billion years old, where do we fit in?
</p>

<p>I believe that we can all learn to look outside our own desires 
    and develop a broader awareness that can expand to reveal 
    that we are all a part of the universal conciousness.  
</p>

<h2>Finance</h2>

<p>People have a hard time recognising that building wealth can be easy.</p>

<p>The hardest part is transitioning from a consumer to a producer.</p>

<p>Humans only need air, water, food, and shelter to survive.</p>
<p>Why are we making these things hard to obtain?</p>

<p>Employees give most of their production away to the employer in return for a
    garunteed wage. You have to treat youself like a business, investing in yourself,
    building your skills, and making a habit of work without immediate reward. 
</p>


<h2>Health, Habits, and Wellness</h2>
<p>Habits are the key to having a happy, productive, well balanced life.</p>
<p>Learn to transition concious thought to unconcious programming that works for 
    you!
</p>

<h2>So you want to be a stagehand?</h2>
<p>I have spent a whole career learning how to be a stagehand</p>
<p>It can be a rewarding experience, but many people struggle gaining the knowlege
    and expereince. I want to bring the skills and techniques of Audio, Video, 
    Lighting, and Rigging
    out of the shadows!
