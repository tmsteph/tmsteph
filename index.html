<h3>My name is Thomas M. Stephens Jr.</h3>

<p> I've been collecting knowlege all over the internet and world.</p>

<p style="padding:.7rem 0rem 1rem 0rem ;">This is somewhat of a portfolio.
</p>
<p>I considered Wordpress, bootstrap, and 
react websites, but wanted to experiment building from scratch.</p>

<h2>Computer Science</h2>

<p>I've always loved exploring computers, but everyone has a had a 
    hard time sitting down to program. There are so many options. So many ways to 
explore and learn.</p> 
<p>I hope that while developing this website we can hash out a path that everyone can use</p>
<br> 

    <h2>Suppliments</h2>
<p>I've found many suppliments to be helpful in my life. Like most people, I 
    have struggled with focus, energy, anxiety, and depression. 
</p> 
<p>Many of these 
things can be relieved through spiritual excercises such as Yoga and Meditation,
but it is nice to have options.</p>
<br>

<h2>Spirituality</h2>

<p>I have been always been fascinated with the bigger picture. 
    Why are we here? Where did we come from? Where are we going?
    What can we do to increase our capacity for love and expand that to 
    help others? </p>

    <p>Humanity has been on this planet for 250,000 years. 
    In a universe that is 4.6 billion years old, where do we fit in?
</p>

<p>I believe that we can all learn to look outside our own desires 
    and develop a broader awareness that can expand to reveal 
    that we are all a part of the universal conciousness.  
</p>
<br>

<h2>Finance</h2>

<p>People have a hard time recognising that building wealth can be easy.</p>

<p>The hardest part is transitioning from a consumer to a producer.</p>

<p>Humans only need air, water, food, and shelter to survive.</p>
<p>Why are we making these things hard to obtain?</p>

<p>Employees give most of their production away to the employer in return for a
    garunteed wage. You have to treat youself like a business, investing in yourself,
    building your skills, and making a habit of work without immediate reward. 
</p>
<br>

<h2>Health, Habits, and Wellness</h2>
<p>Habits are the key to having a happy, productive, well balanced life.</p>
<p>Learn to transition concious thought to unconcious programming that works for 
    you!
</p>
<br>

<h2>So you want to be a stagehand?</h2>
<p>I have spent a whole career learning how to be a stagehand</p>
<p>It can be a rewarding experience, but many people struggle gaining the knowlege
    and expereince. I want to bring the skills and techniques of Audio, Video, 
    Lighting, and Rigging
    out of the shadows!
