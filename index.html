<p>Hello! My name is Thomas Michael Stephens jr. 
I've been collecting knowlege all over the 
internet and world! Here are some of my 
findings!</p>

<p>I'm starting out with basic html. I know how
to Use WordPress, bootstrap, and react, but want
to get back to the basics now that I have a 
modern view of web design. I'd like to create 
Something portable that can run on all devices 
As well as be hosted to the web.
